    <h1>Sentiment Analysis</h1>
    <h2>What is Semantic Analysis?</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Semantic analysis</span> is a crucial component of natural language processing (NLP) that concentrates on understanding the meaning, interpretation, and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences in a given context. It goes beyond merely analyzing a sentence’s syntax (structure and grammar) and delves into the intended meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a crucial component of <span>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span> and the inspiration for applications like chatbots, search engines, and text analysis tools using machine learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tools based on semantic analysis can assist businesses in automatically extracting useful information from unstructured data, including emails, support requests, and consumer comments. We’ll go over its operation below.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Advantages of Semantic Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Semantic analysis offers several advantages across various fields and applications:
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Improved Understanding of Text:</span><br>

Indeed, semantic analysis is pivotal, fostering better user experiences and enabling more efficient information retrieval and processing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>How Semantic Analysis Works?</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Semantic analysis</span>, a natural language processing method, entails examining the meaning of words and phrases to comprehend the intended purpose of a sentence or paragraph. Additionally, it delves into the contextual understanding and relationships between linguistic elements, enabling a deeper comprehension of textual content.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is often accomplished by locating and extracting the key ideas and connections found in the text utilizing algorithms and AI approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Semantic analysis employs various methods, but they all aim to comprehend the text’s meaning in a manner comparable to that of a human. This can entail figuring out the text’s primary ideas and themes and their connections.
    </p>
    <p>
        One popular semantic analysis method combines machine learning and natural language processing to find the text’s main ideas and connections. This can entail employing a machine learning model trained on a vast body of text to analyze new text and discover its key ideas and relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another strategy is to utilize pre-established ontologies and structured databases of concepts and relationships in a particular subject. Semantic analysis algorithms can more quickly find and extract pertinent information from the text by utilizing these ontologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        The analysis, in general, is a key method for assisting computers in comprehending the meaning of natural language text. It has numerous uses in fields including search engines, information retrieval, and machine translation.
    </p>
    
    <h2>In semantic analysis, lexical semantics is crucial because it enables computers to comprehend the connections between lexical elements (words, phrasal verbs, etc.):</h2>
    <p>
        <span>Hyponymy:</span> It illustrates the connection between a generic phrase and its occurrences. In this context, hyponyms describe instances of the generic term hypernym.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Homonymy:</span> It can be explained as when two words have the same form or spelling but a completely distinct meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Polysemy:</span> The Greek term “polysemy” implies “many signs.” It is a phrase or term that has a distinct yet connected meaning. In other words, while polysemy has the same spelling, its purposes are particular yet connected.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Synonymy:</span> This represents the relationship between two lexical elements with different forms but the same or similar meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Antonymy:</span> It is the balanced relationship between two lexical elements about an axis throughout their semantic components.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>Meronomy:</span> It is how text and words are put together in a way that makes sense and shows a part or member of something.
    </p>
