    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        The production of electric power from the footstep movement of people and the pressure exerted during walking, which is often wasted, is the main theme of this paper. The mechanical power transformation into electrical power as the pressure exerted by the footstep and by using transducers is basically called a "Footstep Power Generation System". Power is produced by the power generating floor, which is essentially the production of electrical energy from kinetic energy. As today's electricity demand is increasing and it is unable to overcome this global issue by using traditional power generating sources, the demand and supply gap is the major issue of the energy crisis.
        <br><br>
        The main aim is to overcome the power crisis throughout the world, although it may not be enough to fulfill the excessive demand for electrical energy, it will help reduce reliance on old methods of generating electricity. We can generate 1 megawatt of power if we have a 100-floor building, as we are able to model a power production floor that can generate up to 1000 watts from just twelve footsteps, meaning one unit, and is capable of generating 10,000 watts from just 120 footsteps. This system can be installed on roadside footpaths, parks, jogging tracks, and many other public places like airports, etc., and will have a great impact on and create a significant difference in the electrical power generation system.

    <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The formation of electrical energy from the force exerted by footsteps on the floor is illustrated in this research work. It will be surprising to know how much energy the normal footstep movement on the floor can generate. As thousands of steps per day are taken by each person, electrical energy is generated by the footsteps taken by people as a result of walking. It is a fact that a large amount of energy is lost by each person during routine walks, which is the main source for this system.
        <br><br>
        The approach of this Electro-Kinetic energy floor is to convert kinetic energy into electrical energy by walking on the floor. The energy that is produced from a person walking on the floor is noise and pollution-free. This type of energy is advantageous as it does not need any type of fuel or power source to run. The implementation of this renewable energy in today’s world, where the demand for energy is increasing day by day, is the current solution for this modern world. In this research work, a system is designed which generates power through non-conventional energy sources such as walking on gardens, grounds, and floors, etc. This system is established in heavily populated areas.

    <h2>II. Background</h2>
    <p>
        Most researchers have worked on converting dynamic energy into useful electrical energy by individuals traveling. In reverse electro wetting technique is used wherein the flow of liquid on dielectric material coated. Electrical energy is produced by a conductive substrate. Due to human locomotion, if there is any vibration on the platform, that will cause the production of electrical energy.
        <br><br>
        Researchers at Hull University worked on transferring the motion of an individual into electrical energy. They fixed tiles in various stations in Japan and observed that with an average weight of 60.00kg, 1.00 watt of power is generated in a second. Different mechanisms for generating electricity from footstep power generation processes have been given, such as a rack and pinion gear system attached to a dynamo with its gear mechanisms.

    <h2>III. Literature Survey</h2>
    <h3>III.a Purpose</h3>
    <p>
        To generate electrical energy from footsteps, several methods are used, such as gear wheels and flywheels, to produce power. These methods are used in places where there is a lot of foot traffic because the mechanical portion of this system works on this principle. Footsteps from crowds on the floor and a piezo plate scheme placed below the floor are used for the generation of power. The piezo plate is covered by a sheet, and the piezo sensor experiences a vibrating force from the spring.
        <br><br>
        Electric power is generated in the form of electric current by the striking of the piezo plate on the floor. Power generated by footsteps can be used for additional features like street lighting at pedestrian locations. Credit is given to the pedestrian for the energy which they produce.
    </p>

    <h3>IV. Literary Study</h3>
    <p>
        Footsteps are used for the production of electrical power. The electrical energy produced by footsteps is more than enough. Several methods are described, such as the flywheel and gear wheel method, for generating power. In these steps, piezo plates are also used.
        <br><br>
        • The transformation of energy from mechanical to electrical is done to organize electrical devices.<br>
        • The electrical system is arranged effectively to transfer mechanical energy into electrical energy in a proper manner.<br>
        • Piezo is coupled with the spring, and with the assistance of a sheet, power is generated by the force applied by the spring to vibrate the piezo.<br>
        • A 12-volt lead acid battery is used to store rectified voltage passed through a battery charger circuit produced by footsteps.<br>
        • An inverter and battery are linked. The inverter is designed to convert 12 volts DC into 220 AC.<br>
        • Finally, AC output voltage is used for lighting energy savers, as well as charging laptop batteries, handsets, and other home appliances.<br>
        • If more output is needed, increase the quality and capacity of the inverter and battery, and use more steps for more energy.

    <h3>IV.a Aspects</h3>
    <p>
        Electrical power energy is formed by converting mechanical energy into electrical energy by transforming the movement of footsteps on the floor. A piezo plate is placed there, which is the key feature of power produced through footsteps by piezoelectric sensors. It is a completely risk-free method; the piezoelectric power network is secure and safe to use, and this system will not create trouble or irritate people while using it. Additionally, it will never produce any problems.
        <br><br>
        Although this piezoelectric power system has many mechanical and electrical parts, the losses are very low. Even if the system is damaged or there is a problem with some part, it can easily be replaced because the cost of this system is very low. The batteries in this setup have the potential to store power. Power generation through the footstep system is one of the most cheap and reliable procedures.
    </p>

    <h3>IV.b Upcoming Extent</h3>
    <p>
        Nowadays, there is a lot of focus on renewable energy resources due to the rise in temperature on the Earth's surface, and such projects of footstep power production by piezoelectric sensors have broad aspects. Sterling plant biogas, solar energy, and wind turbines are other non-conventional energy resources used. However, if compared among these non-conventional energy resources, footstep electrical energy production through piezoelectric sensors would be less costly, economical, reliable, and fruitful.
